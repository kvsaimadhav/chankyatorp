          I am all rounder with district, state and national ranks and national medalist or winner at college. I am keen 
          observer, explorer and enthusiast for learning Software Technology as quickly possibly as it is. I define strict 
          rules which cannot be ruled out even by myself. I hope to self-learn and mutually learn with Industry. I have gut
          feeling that intuition will kill any negativity inside us and heal ourselves as fast as possible.
