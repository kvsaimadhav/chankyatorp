          <p>
            I did university degree with completion in 2021. And I know when life gives you infinity problems, We need to think
            &nbsp;that "How to apply lessons learnt in real-life situations. We feeling makes stronger and best. Also, I implement
            &nbsp;the same". However, I faced rejections, attended more than thousands' of interviews, got black mailed by companies
            &nbsp;and faith rejuvenated with family persons. That's how life throws you with problems. Once a good person said,
            &nbsp;"Hope, faith and belief can never be Lost. It can only be...". I asked myself, how to complete that sentence
            &nbsp;Then, I graduated from public university and continued to think positively. I will never ever hurdle thoughts.

          <h3>Bachelors' Alumni</h3>
          <p>
            I graduated from college in 2018. And I strived for life, applied for higher degree in top most universities. 
            &nbsp;I got dual admits i.e., from Canada and later, I need not say. BITS Pilani is there for everyone and vise 
            &nbsp;versa. However, lessons learnt is that "How ever hard life situations be, You got to strive for betterment".
            &nbsp;I never expected those thoughts can be applied in basic skillset development. Thus, I thank everyone for
            valuable support.
